# jb_responsive_breakpoints

An Angular Component to provide media-query events in javascript to other Angular Components

#IMPORTANT!!!

Test functionality of this component without Chrome device emulation resize. 
JavaScript matchMedia seems not to fire events in Chrome device emulation mode.

## Note
The build system consists of a script system with the 'scripts' package for dart. 
This works analoguous to the npm scripts feature.

## Basic Scripts Commands
- scripts get 
- scripts install <package>
- scripts clean
- scripts <customScriptName> (see pubspec.yaml)
